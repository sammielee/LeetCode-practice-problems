#You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

#Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

#Solution
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if (n == 0 or n == 1):
            return 1
        steps = [0]*(n+1)
        steps[0] = 1
        steps[1] = 1
        count = 2
        while (count < n+1):
            steps[count] = steps[count-2] + steps[count-1]
            count+=1
        return(steps[n])
